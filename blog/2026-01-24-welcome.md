This is the lab notebook section of sudoflux.io.

## What Goes Here

Field Notes capture:

- **Experiments**: Things I'm trying that may or may not work
- **Observations**: Interesting behavior I noticed
- **Work-in-progress**: Incomplete findings

## How It Differs from Docs

The main docs sections (VR Lab, Homelab) contain **verified procedures** - things I've tested and confirmed work.

Field Notes are rougher. They might be wrong. They're dated observations, not timeless truths.

Think of it like:

- **Docs** = Textbook (reviewed, verified)
- **Field Notes** = Lab notebook (raw observations)

## The Promotion Path

When a Field Note proves reliable after multiple tests, it gets promoted to a proper doc. The Field Note stays as historical context.
