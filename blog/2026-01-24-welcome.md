## Content Model

**Field Notes** differ from the main documentation:

| Docs | Field Notes |
|------|-------------|
| Verified procedures | Experiments |
| Reproducible claims | Observations |
| Maintained and updated | Historical record |

## Promotion Path

Field Notes that prove reliable after verification are promoted to the main documentation. The Field Note remains as historical context.
