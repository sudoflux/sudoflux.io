# About

## The Site

**sudoflux.io** is a nerd wiki covering:

- **VR Lab**: Pimax Super 50PPD tuning, baselines, and troubleshooting
- **Homelab**: Infrastructure, ZFS storage, media stack, containers

It's structured around a core philosophy: **docs are reproducible claims, field notes are experiments**.

## The Human

I'm a DevOps engineer who spends too much time tweaking VR settings and building homelab infrastructure.
