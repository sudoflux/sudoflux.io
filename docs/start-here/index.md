# Welcome to sudoflux

This is a documentation site and lab notebook covering two main areas:

- **VR Lab**: Pimax Super 50PPD tuning, baselines, troubleshooting, and per-game settings
- **Homelab**: Infrastructure, storage, media stack, and operational knowledge

## How This Site Works

### Docs vs Field Notes

This site separates two types of content:

| Type | Purpose | Quality Bar |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Docs** | Reproducible claims, verified procedures | High - tested, includes version info |
| **Field Notes** | Experiments, observations, work-in-progress | Lower - may be rough, unverified |

**Docs** live in the sidebar navigation. They have templates, "Last verified" metadata, and are meant to be reliable.

**Field Notes** are blog-style posts. They capture what I tried, what I observed, and what I'm still figuring out. Good field notes get promoted to docs once verified.

### Version Sensitivity

VR and homelab configs break constantly due to driver updates, firmware changes, and software releases. Every doc page includes:

- **Last verified**: Date and relevant version numbers
- **Versions tested**: What software/firmware was used

If you're reading a doc and it doesn't work, check the versions first.
