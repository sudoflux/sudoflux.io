### Baselines

Verified starting configurations that work. Start here before tweaking.

- [Baseline Checklist](/docs/vr-lab/baseline-checklist) - The known-good starting point

### Games

## Philosophy

VR tuning is highly version-sensitive. Driver updates, firmware changes, and game patches can invalidate settings overnight. Every page includes:

- **Last verified** date with specific versions
- **Versions tested** section
- Clear indication when something is stale

If a guide doesn't work, check the versions first before assuming user error.
